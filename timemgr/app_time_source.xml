            Provides time data from the application to the time manager. 
            It does not directly update the system time. 
            Instances of this time source are used in some network-specific cases 
            where a session needs to be established before the time data can be retrieved from the source&#8212;for example, a GVP time server.

        <ParamGraph name="remoteUTC">
            The <code>remoteUTC</code> is the UTC time collected from time source, such as the time returned from the GVP server.

		<ParamGraph name="systemUTC">
            The <code>systemUTC</code> is the system UTC at the moment the <code>remoteUTC</code> is collected or received. This acts as a time stamp and reduces the effect of latency in the system.
